## Yield DEX
### L2 Yield Dex Contracts

Nimbora Sync Yield allows users to access L1 yields from L2 without delay, additional gas fees, and liquidity requirements. This is made possible by emitting a share token representing a layer one yield token. Share price is updated at each report, which informs L2 of the yield generated by the L1 strategy.

You will find the L2 contracts [here](https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/nimbora_yields_l2/tree/fix/refacto-and-loop)
Follow the `README` to compile, declare, and deploy the contracts.

Contracts are located under the `./src` folder, main contracts are : 
  - PoolingManager: The pooling manager plays an intermediate role with L2 strategies and L1 communication.

  - Factory: The pooling factory is the contract used to deploy new “strategy packages”: token and token manager, those contracts are the same for any              strategies.

  - TokenManager: The token manager contains all the logic for token accountability through a strategy report, setting the share price at each epoch. It              is also the entry point for deposit and withdraw, only this contract can mint or burn token
